<h1>Hi! I'm Jesse</h1>
<h2>A Software Engineer from Belgium <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/go/go-original.svg" alt="go" width="20" height="20"/></h2> 

I studied Computer Science (Distributed Systems) at KU Leuven, and now I'm working as a Software Engineer at [CERN](https://home.cern). I'm mainly working [reva](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/), a high-performance storage server, written in Go, that maps WebDAV / gRPC / HTTP clients to different storage backends (such as [EOS](https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/) and [CephFS](https://ceph.com))

Apart from this, I'm also interested in:
* Cloud and Distributed Systems technologies ( <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/kubernetes/kubernetes-icon.svg" alt="kubernetes" width="20" height="20"/>, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/amazonwebservices/amazonwebservices-original-wordmark.svg" alt="aws" width="20" height="20"/>, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/docker/docker-original-wordmark.svg" alt="docker" width="20" height="20"/>, <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/firebase/firebase-icon.svg" alt="firebase" width="20" height="20"/>)
* (Applied) Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Systems
* Computer Security: I also like to participate in CTFs
